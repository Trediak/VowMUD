# What is a mud and why are you here?

I can't answer the latter, but quite glad to have you.  A mud, depending on who you talk to, is short for: multi-user dungeon, multi-user domain, or multi-user dimension.  Which one is right?  All of them... or none of them.  Think of a mud as a small MMO before MMOs and presented in text rather than fancy graphics.  It's what really nerdy folks used to play before broadband was readily available and you were generally connecting via a phone line.

# What's with the name and why are you creating this with so many other code bases available?

In the mid 90's I vowed that I would write my own mud codebase before passing into the nether.  Many years later here we are. I'm also using this project to increase my knowledge in python.

# Is the codebase complete and ready for production?

Not even close.  I currently have the following features in place:

* Handle multiple TCP connections
* Authentication and account creation
* Command processor
* World Map
* Backend DB through sqlite3
* Room display and movement
* Basic chat with gossip and direct message

# What other features are planned and what is the expected cadence?

I am hoping to push a new major feature every 10-14 days until completion.  The following is not an all-inclusive list of additional features in no particular order:

* Character creation (3 -5 basic classes)
* NPCs and Monsters
* Spells, weapons, and other items
* Combat
* Room switches
* Money system and bank
* Inventory system
* Quests
* Crafting and gathering
* Dungeons designed and balanced for parties
* Web front-end for admin and building
* Add websockets and custom browser client

Technical features:
* Real error handling
* Testing
* Full documentation for code and game

I'm not a perfect coder but my stuff works.  Again, this project is meant to help me improve.

At the moment, I'm not looking for additional contributers as this is a personal project for me.  However, I would be happy to hear from you and entertain additional features so drop me a line.
